            <p>Andrew was born in Richmond, BC, however he has, since the age of 5, grown up in Surrey, BC.  Andrew loves
               to draw, make music, code and drink with friends every weekend.  Since, Andrew is a student, his income has
               suffered because of this, but he is satisfied.  Andrew enrolled into BCIT to get an upgrade to his education
               and hopes to transfer into ubc afterwards.</p>
